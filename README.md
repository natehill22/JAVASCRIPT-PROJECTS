# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS
This repository is for my (Nathaniel Hill's) Tech Academy JavaScript projects. The projects within this folder were used primarily for learning and practicing new JavaScript concepts (including AJAX, JQuery, React, API fetches, etc.).

## Student Portfolio
This page is the culmination of all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript learning I've done so far. It is an active portfolio webpage for me as a developer. I've updated it with JavaScript to include a slideshow, navigation buttons and image-representative dots (also to help with slideshow navigation), and a PopUp contact form. Much work was also done to make it mobile friendly. 

## Project 7 (Basic)
This page, while barebones, introduced us to using JavaScript to perform math and requested I make use of new (to me) concepts like new Date() and Math.random(). I had a lot of fun with these projects and ended up making a function that returns a random number and conditional answers based upon where it is in reference to 5, several time-based functions that alter based upon the time of day that you interact with them, and a Coin Flip function that you can play over and over again and even utilizes some validations. 

## HTML2
This project was the first lesson in JavaScript form validations, and I got really into it. Validation work really suits me because it leads to a stronger overall product--I love predicting how people will interact with the product and shielding against potential eventualities. For this project, I used JavaScript validations for empty form error messages and regex for the specific email and phone number formatting error messages. I also used CSS to create the style of the page.

## NumberAPItest
Here, I was tasked with writing a program that interacted with a free online API to perform a viewable result, and after figuring one out, I felt compelled to do more. I ended up writing three on one page, all triggered through separate buttons. The first returns a random fact about cats, the second produces an image of a dog, and the third returns a sentence translated into Gungan (from Star Wars); while the sentence is always static, the fact and image will update every time their buttons are presssed. 

## TicTacToe
In this project, I made a working TicTacToe game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Functions, conditional statements, loops, audio, and the HTML canvas were all used to complete this game.  

## Pizza Drill
Here, I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make a website for ordering pizza and calculating the total amount of charge due (factoring in for 1 free topping) and then displaying that value on the page. The focus of the project was on using JavaScript to do math and to show that the console log can be used to help in programming (there are a of details that show in the console log on ths project). Functions and conditional statements were used to complete this page. 

## React_1
The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with React by creating a counter program. I used components, props and factories to write a program that compares the time of initial button press and the current time to tell you how many fractions of a second have passed. I liked that React utilizes a VDOM and keepts track of state (through diffs) to help it apply updates effeciently. 

## JQuery Classic Cars
This project was used as the introduction to using JQuery; in the project, I used JQuery methods to add animated "shine" and scroll/sizing effects, to hide and show elements to create and FAQ, and to use mouseenter/mouseleave events to show and hide car titles based upon mouse placement. I really enjoyed the concise syntax of JQuery--it felt having similar levels of functionality for far less code.  

## Calculator
In this lesson, I learned how to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to make a calculator. I used many functions, event listeners, conditional statements and variables to create the many functionalities expected of a calculator (clearing, decimals, adding, subtract, multiplication, division, recognizing button clicks, keeping track of values, updating the display, etc..
