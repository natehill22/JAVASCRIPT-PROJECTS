# JAVASCRIPT-PROJECTS

## Student Portfolio
This page is the culmination of all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript learning I've done so far. It is an active portfolio webpage for me as a developer. I've updated it with JavaScript to include a slideshow, navigation buttons and image-representative dots (also to help with slideshow navigation), and a PopUp contact form. Much work was also done to make it mobile friendly. 

## Project 7 (Basic)
This page, while barebones, introduced us to using JavaScript to perform math and requested I make use of new (to me) concepts like new Date() and Math.random(). I had a lot of fun with these projects and ended up making a function that returns a random number and conditional answers based upon where it is in reference to 5, several time-based functions that alter based upon the time of day that you interact with them, and a Coin Flip function that you can play over and over again and even utilizes some validations.
