## Student Portfolio
This page is the culmination of all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript learning I've done so far. It is an active portfolio webpage for me as a developer. I've updated it with JavaScript to include a slideshow, navigation buttons and image-representative dots (also to help with slideshow navigation) and a PopUp contact form. Much work was also done to make it mobile friendly. 

## Academy Cinemas
This page is an example movie website that utilized Bootstrap. It contains many Bootstrap elements and custom adjustments including form, cards, drowdowns, navbar, footer and internal links. 

## Album Challenege (Bootstrap)
This page is the product of an assignment to utilize a Bootstrap template to design and display a page; I chose to make an Album about giant flightless birds. This page has no stylesheet--only Bootstrap library elements. Working with limitations in that existing framework, I relied solely on existing Bootstrap elements to help me fulfill my vision.   

## HTML Challenges
This page is the result of a series of challenges that I chose to place upon a singular page. Styled with CSS, it contains a footer, navbar, image and video with text overlay, images with varying filters and columns, and a table.  

## Simple Recipes
This page displays more complicated styling; it was intended to be an example recipe-based website that shares with the community. Styled with CSS, it focuses on recipe cards that flip to reveal cooking deatils. It contains a footer, form, internal links, and columned image containers, transforming elements, and more complicated navbar. 

## The Pet Shop
This page is an example pet shop website; it was created to teach about linking, image and video, filter overlays, columns forms, and footers. It's been styled with CSS and contains two pages with shared styling. 

## One Page Website
This page is a result of my desire to showcase the nuance between different kinds of baked goods in the "cobbler" family. It's been styled with CSS and focused on topnav, footer, background image, form, and video/images. 

## Grace Hopper Project
This page comes from a lesson on how to learn to find all elements necessary to make a webpage. Styled with CSS, it contains a header, image, links, and much text (and text formatting).
